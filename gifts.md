### Lists
*The first 5 or so items of each list are sorted according to preference.*

<hr/>

__$5 - $30 [Music][music]__ The list of albums I want is always pretty long,
and I'm always happy to get an album on this list.

__$25 - $200 [Books][books]__ The list of books (mostly technical) I'd like
to read is also usually quite long.


__Mostly over $100 [Other][other]__ Lastly, I have an amazon wish-list for 
items that don't fit in the other categories. These tend to be larger items.

### Items not on Amazon 
<hr/>
__$57__ 4Sevens [Quark Click QK2A](http://www.foursevens.com/products/QK2A-AE-1234)
