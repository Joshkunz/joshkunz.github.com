### Lists
<hr/>

__$5 - $30__ I love getting new music, I even maintain an amazon wish-list
of albums I would like to buy (the list is in no particular order): 
[Music][music].

__$40 - $200__ I also love getting books, I have a separate amazon wish-list
for books I'm looking to buy (the list is in no particular order): 
[Books][books].

Lastly, I have an amazon wish-list for random items I want to buy that don't 
fit under the above categories. Prices range wildly, but they are usually 
$100 or more: [Other][other].

### Misc Items
<hr/>
__About $250-$400__ A [rackmount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19-inch_rack) 
server chassis with 6-8 hot-swappable bays (4U or less, less is better).

__$250 or less__ Full ATX (ideally compatible with an ATX PSU) rackmount chassis (4U, no less).

__Should probably be $400-$700__ A relatively recent Xeon processor with
 6 or more cores.

__About $400-$600__ A 3000-4500psi carbon fiber [SCBA][scba] (*not* SCUBA) 
tank, the bigger the better. Used is fine, is shouldn't be older than 15 
years or so. I can take care of getting it [re-hydro'd][hydro], so don't 
worry about that.
