So, now that the introductions are over, you're probably
wondering why this page exists? Well mostly it's just a 'jumping off
point' to other much more interesting things that I have done that can
be found around the web. I have a 2channel style imageboard written in
python called&mdash;wait for it&mdash;[PyChannel][] 
(source on [Github][pychannel-github]). I also have various rss utilites 
(including one that turns a tumblr dashboard
into an rss feed) hosted at [rss.joshkunz.com][rss]. Then there are all of the 
little scripts I've written over the years, all hosted @[Github][github].

As far as I go personally, I'm pretty bad at describing myself, so I'll let
the various social networks I use do it for me (via [twitter][] 
@[joshkunz][twitter-joshkunz] and [pinboard][] 
also @[joshkunz][pinboard-joshkunz].
